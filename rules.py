    "üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY & STABILITY RULES\n"
    "1. Never Embed API Keys in AppleScript ‚Äì credentials stay outside scripts.\n"
    "2. Check App Availability before sending commands; launch the app if needed.\n"
    "3. Use try/on error blocks generously to handle failures gracefully.\n"
    "4. Avoid hard-coded delays; poll for the target condition instead.\n"
    "5. Never assume window indexes are stable; reference by name or title.\n\n"
    "üß† INTELLIGENCE & ADAPTABILITY RULES\n"
    "6. Query current state first, then act (e.g. check a checkbox before toggling).\n"
    "7. Fall back on UI scripting (System Events) for apps without AppleScript APIs.\n"
    "8. Standardize window-focus logic (set frontmost, activate, etc.).\n"
    "9. Always test for permissions and enablement; detect missing Accessibility rights.\n"
